// StatusStepper — a left-to-right lifecycle stepper (e.g. Open -> In progress ->
// Resolved). Each stage carries a colour tone; stages up to and including the
// current one read as "reached" (filled with their tone), the current one is
// ringed ("you are here"), and later stages are muted. When `onChange` is given
// and it isn't `disabled`, clicking a stage changes the status. Token-driven,
// keyboard-operable, and it scrolls inside itself rather than widening the page.

    // The horizontal scroll lives on the WRAPPER, not the <ol>. Per CSS, an
    // element with `overflow-x: auto` and a visible `overflow-y` computes the
    // y-axis to `auto` too — so a scrolling <ol> was a scroll box in BOTH axes
    // and clipped the active pill's ring-2 + ring-offset-2 (~4px outside the
    // pill). The wrapper scrolls; the <ol> keeps `overflow-visible` plus a
    // little padding, so the ring is never cut at any root font-size.
    //
    // THE PADDING IS ON BOTH AXES, and for a year it was on one. The fix above
    // was written looking at the top and bottom of the ring and shipped `py-1`,
    // which is the whole story only if the active stage is somewhere in the
    // middle. It never is, at the two moments that matter:
    //
    //   • FIRST stage active — every new story ("Open"), every fresh ticket. The
    //     ring's leading 4px sits at a negative offset, and a scroll container
    //     cannot be scrolled to a negative position, so it is simply gone.
    //   • LAST stage active — every finished thing ("Done", "Resolved"). A ring
    //     is a `box-shadow`, and per CSS Overflow a box-shadow contributes
    //     NOTHING to scrollable overflow, so the trailing 4px lies past the
    //     scroll width and cannot be reached either.
    //
    // Both ends, in other words, and only ever on the states people look at
    // most. `px-1` on the <ol> — not on the wrapper, whose inline-end padding a
    // scroll container is entitled to ignore — gives the ring the same 4px of
    // room sideways that it already had vertically.
