// `Popover` is Radix's Root verbatim, so every Root prop forwards — including
// **`modal`**, which matters more than it looks:
//
// A popover is portaled to <body>. When one opens inside a Dialog, the Dialog's
// scroll lock (react-remove-scroll) preventDefaults wheel/touchmove on every
// node outside its own subtree — which now includes the popover. Typing still
// works, scrolling is dead. `modal` makes the popover own the scroll lock for
// its own content, so a long list scrolls again.
//
// It stays OFF by default: a modal popover traps focus and blocks outside
// clicks, so in a normal page you could no longer click straight from one
// filter to the next. Components that may live in a Dialog (Choice, FilterBar)
// take a `modal` prop and pass it through — see their docs.
